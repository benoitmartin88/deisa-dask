Tests for the mergeable PCA primitives (local summary, exact merge, balanced merge tree).

Why these tests do not compare components elementwise
-----------------------------------------------------
The sign of an eigenvector is arbitrary: LAPACK is free to return ``+v`` or ``-v``, and it does so depending on the
matrix's conditioning. A test asserting raw component equality therefore fails for a correct implementation and passes
for a broken one, which is the worst of both. Every accuracy assertion here is sign-invariant, via one of:

- **M1** ``subspace_distance(a, b, k)``: ``1 - min singular value`` of the overlap of the two leading ``k``-dimensional
  row subspaces. 0 means "same subspace", independent of signs and of any rotation inside the subspace. Both operands
  must be cut to the SAME ``k`` first, otherwise the truncated subspace is trivially a subspace of the full one.
- **M2** ``rel_var_error(sv_summary, sv_ref_full)``: relative error of the retained total variance against the
  FULL-rank batch reference. This is the metric for truncation: it falls monotonically as ``local_rank`` grows, which
  the raw per-component error does NOT do (it reads ~2.0 at exact reconstruction, i.e. maximally different).
- **M3** ``row_sign_fixed_error(a, b)``: per-row minimum of ``|a_i - b_i|`` and ``|a_i + b_i|``. Used only to pin the
  sign-invariance of the code, never as a quality metric.

Tolerances follow the technical spec: singular values and subspace distance ``< 1e-10``, means ``< 1e-12``, the
permutation spread of an associative merge ``< 1e-8``. All of those sit one to three orders of magnitude above the
residuals actually observed (1e-13 to 1e-16) because the exact digits are BLAS dependent.
