Tests for the MergeablePCA Dask estimator: exact fit, local_rank trade-off, graph shape, and refusals.

Two reference implementations, and why both
---------------------------------------------
The estimator is checked against scikit-learn's ``PCA`` wherever scikit-learn is importable, and against a
numpy-only SVD reference everywhere else. The card that introduced the reference ("numpy SVD reference - sklearn is
NOT available") predates scikit-learn 1.9.1 landing in the venv; using the real library when present is strictly
stronger than a hand-rolled reference, so both live here:

- ``sklearn_pca(...)`` guards every sklearn-only test, so the suite still passes in an environment without
  scikit-learn, exactly as the card requires. The import is INSIDE the test, not at module level: a module-level
  ``importorskip`` would skip this whole file, silently disabling every exactness assertion below it.
- ``batch_pca`` below is the numpy-only fallback and is always used for the core exactness assertions, so the
  load-bearing tests never silently skip when a dependency is missing.

Metrics
-------
Sign invariance, again. Eigenvector sign is arbitrary, so components are NEVER compared elementwise. Every accuracy
assertion uses one of:

- **M1** ``subspace_distance(a, b, k)``: ``1 - min singular value`` of the overlap of the two leading ``k``-dimensional
  row subspaces. 0 means "same subspace", independent of signs and of any rotation inside the subspace. Both operands
  are cut to the SAME ``k``; every call site pins ``k < n_features``, because two ``d``-dimensional subspaces of
  ``R**d`` are trivially the whole space and the metric would be vacuous.
- **M2** ``rel_var_error(sv_summary, sv_ref_full)``: relative error of the retained total variance against the
  FULL-rank batch reference. This is the metric for truncation: it falls monotonically as ``local_rank`` grows.
- **max_abs_error``: only ever on sign-free quantities (singular values, means, explained variances).

Why the "no compute" assertions are structural rather than observational
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The regression this file guards is the export's visualize bug: ``compute()`` called inside the graph builder, so the
graph could not be drawn. Re-testing it by watching for scheduler activity is inherently racy. Instead the tripwire is
DETERMINISTIC: the array's blocks are produced by a ``map_blocks`` function with a module-level side effect, and
``_fit_dask_delayed`` is called while a counter is live. If the builder computed anything, the counter would move. It
is reset to zero right after the array is built, because dask touches blocks once while inferring ``meta``.

    scheduler but no Client active" -- an order-dependent failure that lands on whichever test this worker runs next,
    which under ``-n 16 --dist loadgroup`` is how 37 of these tests failed for a reason unrelated to the estimator.
