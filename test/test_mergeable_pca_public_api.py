"""
Tests for the MergeablePCA public API surface: ``from deisa.dask import MergeablePCA``.

These are packaging tests, not algorithm tests: the algebra is covered in test_mergeable_pca.py,
test_mergeable_pca_axes.py and test_mergeable_pca_estimator.py. What is checked here is that the estimator is
reachable from the top-level package, that it is advertised in ``__all__``, and that the re-export is the very same
object as the definition, so the two cannot drift apart silently.

Why a real import and not a source scan
---------------------------------------
A grep over ``__init__.py`` would pass on a file that re-exports a name that does not exist, or on an export guarded
so that it is skipped at import time. The only way to know the documented public import actually works is to execute
it, so every test below imports the name at run time, and ``test_import_works_in_a_clean_interpreter`` executes it in
a separate interpreter with no test-time state at all.
